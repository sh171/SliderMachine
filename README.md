# Slider Machine

The Slider Machine serves as an exploration into the deeper intricacies of the Document Object Model (DOM) and the utilization of the addEventListener() method. Through this project, I've honed the capability to dynamically create sliders and understand user interactions on a GUI, subsequently processing the related data.

## Description
The application's interface is bifurcated into two distinct layouts:

- Left Layout: Features a dynamic slider function. The slider's position adjusts based on corresponding number inputs.
- Right Layout: Houses an informational section accompanied by actionable buttons. When users interact with these buttons, a specific baseball team is showcased based on the designated slider's position.
